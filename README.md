# my_journal
A web journal application.

Created for personal use (as of now) to track my learning and journal my progress.

A secure, efficient way to track my learning, where I can search for things I have learned and note my resources for future personal uses and for others as well. 

Intended to require authentication, be able to customize personal profile, create/edit/delete journal entries, systematic tagging, searching db for past entries, etc.
